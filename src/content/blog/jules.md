# Chorus 1
Bendy was a lil’ devil thing
Who was brought to life on the silver screen
Used to make 'em chuckle now he makes 'em scream
It’s Bendy in the Devil’s Swing
Flash back to the place that made the cartoons sing
Where the cobwebs grow and the floorboards creak
And it’s all connected to an evil scheme
It’s Bendy and the Ink Machine

# Verse 1
Dreams do come true
I was deceived by Joey Drew
And now I’m coming after you
Who’s laughing now?
You thought that you could cut me out
But now the ink is pouring down

# Chorus 2
Bendy was created out of ink
And then molded into a 3D beast
You can hear him coming by his tapping feet
It’s Bendy in the Devil’s Swing
Snap back to the era when the swing was king
But the workshops fading and behind the scenes
There’s a deep dark secret hidden underneath
It’s Bendy and the Ink Machine

# Verse 2
Hey Joey, I got your message
There’s still a sketch on my old work desk
It might have a been a bit overzealous
To collect all six of those office relics
I haven’t seen my peers in over 30 years
But there’s no one here, except grinding gears
And my rising fears

# Pre-Chorus
"The Illusion of Living" was only the beginning
Ink incarnate that’s sinning, presented in Sillyvision
"The Illusion of Living" was only the beginning
Ink incarnate that’s sinning presented in Sillyvision

# Chorus 3
Bendy was a villain out of sync
Now he’s off the page and he’s on the brink
And his old pal Boris might have lost a spleen
It’s Bendy in the Devil’s Swing
A cartoon cutout that’ll make you shriek
Yeah your heart starts racing when you hear that beat
The creator’s brain might have sprung a leak
It’s Bendy and the Ink Machine

# Bridge
1-2-3, to 3D
You and me- Ink Machine
Flashing screens, dancing fiend
Bendy sings, devil’s swing
# Instrumental- Swing break

Where the cobwebs grow and the floorboards creak
And it’s all connected to an evil scheme
It’s Bendy and the Ink Machine
